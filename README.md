The aim of this project to evaluate how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistics bikes differently.

## Input files:

## Output files:
The data was anaylsed using R for the summer season (i.e. June-August 2021). Cleaned and processed data can be found in the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11_8XqfHfX8p7RbfdjOjqQfSqFWACrkql?usp=sharing)

## 

## Results:
The data reveals a preference among members for Classic bikes and to a lesser extent Electric bikes, compared to casual riders who prefer all three types (Classic, Docked, and Electric). The average trip duration for casual riders is longer, at 0.6 hours, while members tend to have shorter trips of 0.2 hours. Among the three types, Docked bikes have the longest average trip duration of 1.43 hours, followed by Classic bikes at 0.4 hours and Electric bikes at 0.3 hours.
